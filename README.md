# PyPiano
A simple piano in python.

This is a multi-processed version of pianoputer (https://github.com/Zulko/pianoputer).
Most of the code was taken from that project and just tweaked to be able to run two event loops.
Credit goes to https://github.com/Zulko for creating a great piano virtual interface.

In addition to all the other options that are supplied by pianoputer, this project also adds
a sostenuto pedal (Spacebar by default) to allow the suspension and sustaining of notes.
